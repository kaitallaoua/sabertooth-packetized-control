# sabertooth-packetized-control
This is code to drive Sabertooths in LabVIEW with a myRIO 1900. It should work with any sabertooth in packetized serial mode.
Tested on a 2x12, 2x60.
For more information on the 2x60: https://www.dimensionengineering.com/products/sabertooth2x60

# Usage:

1) clone the repo
2) remove "removethesewords" from the extension of the "sabertooth-packetized-control.lvprojremovethesewords" template project file (this is because the lvproj file may contain sensitive/private info, so use the template and update it as you like)
Note: all .aliases and .lvlps files will be auto generated by labview for you, dont worry about them.
3) you should now have the project file: "sabertooth-packetized-control.lvproj"
4) open project file and have fun!
